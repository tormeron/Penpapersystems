Guideline #3 Levelling
In contrast to your run of the mill Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, levelling in this system
should be fast, since you need to remember that some of these points will be sacrificed at
ressurections, and they will need it in order to be able to beat stronger monsters.
A good guideline for how often to level, for every hour of session time, if it's packed with
activity, the characters should level.
Great strategy or ideas, level them.
Remember as opposed to any other system, this system you can adjust monsters to fit the
players and not have to deal with monsters which are not evenly matched with the player.
An important note is that while your group might have this character which has 20 physical
and do a lot of damage with every hit, he still needs to hit. Consider using ranged or give your
monsters more quick to make them more able to block attacks
