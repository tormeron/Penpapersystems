Guideline #1 Battle fairness

The following should give you a fair way to measure when an encounter is fair, the
measurement is 1 Player vs 1 Monster.
Very easy = 1
Easy = 2
Moderate = 3
Hard = 4
Very hard = 5
Nearly impossible = 6+

The logic would be for every hit the player must land on the monster it augments the dificulty
by 1.
and for every hit the monster needs to land that is less than the players need to hit it
augments the dificulty by 2.
if the monster needs only 1 hit to kill a player augment difficulty by an additional 3
