Combat
In combat a few mechanics are put into place, instead of your usual Armor class that comes into play.
first the player or monster rolls an attack/ spell attack roll, then the defending creature rolls a defend roll, if attack
score is higher than defend score then that attack hits and does 1 damage to the creature.
Any spells cast as AOE apply only 1/2 spellpower to damage rolls.
Using cover against ranged attacks gives you
partial cover - +1/2 intelligence to defend
full cover - +intelligence to defend
Logic should also be implemented if the cover is large enough to completely protect the target then no attack can
hit.
The bonus to full cover applies if the cover isn't 100% protecting. (for example hiding behind a tree branch might
still get you hit by arrows sinking through the branch.)
