Levelling
levelling is not a long process in this D&D, you do something special or you fought some monster or you just hit
some milestone the DM might let you just level
the base HP of any level 1 character is 5
at level 1 you start with 5 points to give yourself to any of the attributes that can be modified at level up.
each level above level 1 gets 1 point to spend on the attributes
