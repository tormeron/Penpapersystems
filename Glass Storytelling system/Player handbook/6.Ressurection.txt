Ressurection

there might come a time in which a character might die, or an important NPC might die and need to be ressurected.

the character ressurecting must have at least 2 heal to do the ritual
the party that is ressurecting the character would need to sacrifice 5 HP permanently in order to ressurect. 
(it can be donated only from willing members, the amount can be anything from 1-5 until a total of 5 HP have been donated)
Ressurection of any character is only possible if it has died less than 1 minute per heal point ago.
