(Pen and Paper)
This is a simplified roleplaying game.

This game is not meant to replace Dungeons and Dragons when playing a long campaign and want the depth of characters in Dungeons and dragons but it is a way to quickly and easily create characters for playing with friends and family that are not very knowledgeable about Pen and paper games.

This system is class and race agnostic. it is minimal on rules, allowing for DMs to add anything they want to it.
