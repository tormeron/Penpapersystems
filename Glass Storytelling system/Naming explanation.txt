Glass storytelling system has been named thus to reflect better what the system is about.

The system is about storytelling, simple and open for all to see through.

Though within glass boxes you might find a lot of other things such as the extensions people might write for the core rules.
Some of the extensions will extend upon what the core rules said, some might write about a topic that the core rules never dealt with and some might tweak / change the core rules to fit their idea of a setting better.

The important part about this system is that this system might be altered to fit anyone's idea of a better system whenever they see fit.
