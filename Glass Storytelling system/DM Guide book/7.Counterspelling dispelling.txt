Guideline #6 Counterspelling & Dispelling

Much like defense, spellcasting can be countered by an apropriate spell.

Optional: counterspelling would require the player rolling a D10 + his spellpower.
The total needs to be above the spellpower of the enemy casting the spell and would take away his attack / turn.
