Guideline #2 Character death

Even with the best planning a campaign might go south and a player might die.
There are 2 ways to deal with it:

1. Group ressurection – the group decides to sacrifice the 5 HP in order to get their friends back to life

2.1. Other healers – the group decides to sacrifice 5 HP but need help from an external healer, should have a low price

2.2 Ressurection total – The group decides it cannot sacrifice the HP required and is willing to pay for a full ressurection
The longer the character is dead for the higher the payment should be for ressurecting their friends in the city / town.

Ressurection should never become a norm to the group, if it does, maybe your campaign is too hard, consider making monsters with a lower dificulty level (see guideline #1)
Alternatively, your players might not be good enough for your campaigns, consider lowering the monsters difficulty.
