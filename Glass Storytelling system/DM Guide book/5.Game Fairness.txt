Guideline #4 Game fairness
While guideline #3 is important, do make sure to convey the difference in strength from one monster to another. 

You need to remember that they don't know you tweak each monster. 
Thus if you have a monster that is super quick, maybe portray it by describing strong and fast feet or in any other way you wish.
