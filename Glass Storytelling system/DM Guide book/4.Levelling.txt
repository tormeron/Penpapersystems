Guideline #3 Levelling

In contrast to your run of the mill Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, levelling in this system should be fast, since you need to remember that some of these points will be sacrificed at ressurections, and they will need it in order to be able to beat stronger monsters.

A good guideline for how often to level, for every hour of session time, if it's packed with activity, the characters should level.
Great strategy or ideas, level them.

Remember as opposed to any other system, this system you can adjust monsters to fit the players and not have to deal with monsters which are not evenly matched with the player.

An important note is that while your group might have this character which has 20 physical and do a lot of damage with every hit, he still needs to hit. 

Consider using ranged or give your monsters more quick to make them more able to block attacks
