Concentration

One of the side rules that have been specified in the core rules but never quite explained thoroughly.

Concentration is the ability of a spellcaster to retain his attention on a spell effect for lasting effect as long as the concentration holds.

Every DM might decide when concentration is broken.

Here are some options of when concentration could be broken:

1. When the spellcaster suffers any damage
2. When the spellcaster suffers more than 1/4 of the total hitpoints as damage
3. when the spellcaster suffers more than 1/2 of the total hitpoints as damage
4. If the spellcaster is rendered unconcious
5. If one of the spellcaster's components is unavailable to him, such as speach or hand movement
6. other

How to deal with broken concentration:

1. Roll a d100 and anything above 50 the spellcaster manages to retain it's concentration for each specific spell in concentration
2. same as one but one roll applies to all spells in concentration
3. the spell is cancelled
4. the spell is cancelled and as a result a wild magic effect occurs (up to the DM)
5. the spell is reversed upon the caster
6. the spell is cancelled but due to cutting it short an explosion occurs causing a certain amount of damage upon the caster
7. same as 6 but instead it's on target the explosion.
