You enter an old crypt, spider webs decorate the ancient entrance, the big rocks that hold this place open are overgrown and chipped in many places, 3 long scratch marks go over the wall on one side, as you delve deeper you find yourself following narrow passages leading you like a maze to your destination.
After dealing with some kobolds and some hobgoblins along the path you reach the halls of power of a mage that used to live here, the name is emblazoned upon the ceiling in an eternal fire that never dies, “TORMERON”.
As you look around you see rows upon rows of ancient neatly ordered books.
You go through the books and draw a book out of the library named “Tormeron’s basic guide to Magic and spellcasting”

As you open this ancient tome the following text is written on the first pages:
“Magic is everywhere and is like a web everyone can draw upon, when the first of spellcasters found out magic they found the extensiveness of what magic could one day become.
In old magic training books there is a passage which says “To all who follow my path the bars of reality shall be bent and the impossible is possible if you have the imagination to do it!”

Books upon books lay in old libraries teaching new forms of magic and giving birth to ideas that were once commonly practiced but long forgotten.”
